### Task
Implement following array methods by yourself: filter, map, forEach, some, every, reverse. All of the functions should accept arrays as a parameter and a callback function, and as in array methods you must provide correct arguments to callbacks
Example reverse function
```js
  function reverse(arr) {
    const result = [];
    for (let i = arr.length; i > 0; i--) {
      result.push(arr[i]);
    }
    return result;
  }
  reverse([2,3,4,56,5,8]) // expected output is [8, 5, 56, 4, 3, 2]
